Introduction

Acne and pimples are among the most common skin concerns affecting teenagers and adults alike. While often dismissed as a “normal” part of growing up, persistent acne can affect not just the skin but also a person’s confidence and self-esteem. At Dr. Neha Sodhi’s Skin, Hair & Laser Clinic, we focus on addressing the root causes of acne while providing safe and effective treatments tailored to every skin type.

What Exactly Are Acne and Pimples?

Acne is a skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria.

Pimples are one of the visible signs of acne and may appear as whiteheads, blackheads, papules, pustules, nodules, or cysts.

Common Causes of Acne

Excess Oil Production – Overactive sebaceous glands clog the pores.

Bacteria – Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) triggers inflammation.

Hormonal Changes – Fluctuations during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, or stress can aggravate acne.

Genetics – Family history plays a role in acne severity.

Diet & Lifestyle – High sugar intake, junk food, and stress may worsen breakouts.

Myths vs. Facts About Acne

Myth: Acne is caused by poor hygiene.
Fact: Acne is not due to “dirty skin” but rather internal and hormonal factors.

Myth: Only teenagers get acne.
Fact: Many adults also suffer from acne due to stress, hormones, and lifestyle.

Myth: Sun exposure clears acne.
Fact: While sunlight may temporarily dry out pimples, it often worsens skin damage and pigmentation.
